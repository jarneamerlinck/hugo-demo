# Hugo

In hugo you can create a new page with

```bash
hugo new post/name_of_file.md
```

this will create a new markdown file with the default template.

> make sure you add `-D` flag to the hugo server command so it will build drafts.
>
> As you need at least 1 file for the posts page to load in.
